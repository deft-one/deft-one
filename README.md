# **Hi, I'm Carib**.

#### I've been building websites with HTML, CSS PHP, MySQL and Javascript for a few years now.

#### Recently, I've committed to learning and using :atom: React, and it's been a fun ride!

#### You can see some of the projects I've worked on below.

* [Valentine](https://deft-one.github.io/Valentine/) - An interactive Valentine that I built for my wife (then-girlfriend).

* [Homosassa Fishing](https://deft-one.github.io/homosassafishing/) - One of my earliest attempts at building a website prototype.  I didn't have much experience at the time and I was experimenting with animations.

* [Michelle Charlene Photography](https://deft-one.github.io/Michelle-Charlene-Photography/) - This is a clone of a simple and clean website I built for a friend and local photographer.

* [Under Pressure Exterior Cleaning](https://deft-one.github.io/under-pressure/) - A clone of a website I built for a local exerior cleaning business.

* [Florian Royack](https://deft-one.github.io/florianroyack/) - A pretty basic React clone of a website I built for a local realtor.  The original site was not made with React.

* [Intereactive Call Scripts](https://deft-one.github.io/interactive_call_scripts/) - My first React site!  I attempted to use React to recreate another Intereactive Call Scripts site I built with PHP.  The original can't be hosted on GitHub, but it had a login, pasword reset, user database, scripts database, script editor and much more functionality.  This version is far more simple.

* [CSS Grid Positioning Tool](https://deft-one.github.io/CSS-Grid-Tool/) - A very simple gadget that helps with learning CSS Grid positioning.

* [Dynamic To-Do List](https://deft-one.github.io/Dynamic-To-Do-List/) - I'll bet you've NEVER seen a to-do list before.  No one ever makes these.

* [Simple Calculator](https://deft-one.github.io/Simple-Calculator/) - Need to add, subtract, multiply or divide?  This little guy has you covered.

* [Out-The-Door Calculator](https://deft-one.github.io/OTD-Calculator/) - Want to know how much that new Tesla is gonna cost you?  This tool can show you total cost as well as monthly payments.
