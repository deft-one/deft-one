# Hi, I'm Carib.

#### I've been building websites with HTML, CSS PHP, MySQL and Javascript for a few years now.

#### Recently, I've committed to learning and using :atom: React, and it's been a fun ride!

#### I'll be completely recreating my [Interactive Call Scripts](https://www.deftoriginals.com/interactive-call-scripts/) project with React and pushing it to Github soon!

#### Try out the current version!

#### Most of my projects on here are copies of websites I have built for clients of my business Deftoriginals.

#### I'm open to new projects, job offers, colaboration and conversations about web development and coding in general, so please feel free to reach out!
